                <h2>A Strategic Approach to Cryptocurrency Trading</h2>
                <img src="./assests/navigate_bull_run.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Within the cryptocurrency markets, one should stick to a well planned trading strategy. Thanks to
                    the insights gained from @karasurrect's private telegram group, I've honed in on a strategy that not
                    only minimizes risk but also enhances the potential for substantial rewards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the volatile realm of crypto, risk management is a must. Opting for spot trading over leverage
                    trading has proven to be a wise decision in protecting funds, avoiding the posibility of
                    liquidation. Learning this lesson, having liquidated more crypto than some earn in a year, I
                    realized the importance of spot trading to build a solid foundation of understanding the markets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My investment philosophy revolves around trading coins or tokens that could be held with a long-term
                    outlook. Today, I digress from shilling specific cryptocurrencies, keeping you in suspence for a
                    future blog post.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My focus is on mid-cap cryptocurrencies that tend to make higher and lower price swings, offering a
                    balance of risk and reward. These trades and investments are kept to cryptocurrencies ranked between
                    100-450 on coinmarketcap.com. I prioritize trading cryptocurrencies listed on major exchanges
                    particularly Binance and Coinbase due to their substantial liquidity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Timing is crucial and difficult to master while trading. I advocate for buying after a market crash
                    due to news or a stagnent market, but with caution. Waiting for a stabilization period of 1-3 days
                    after bearish trends turn bullish to ensure a more informed entry point. Implementing a dollar-cost
                    averaging buy approach throughout the day after the candles stop hitting lower lows further
                    mitigates the impact of market volatility.
                <p>
                    It would be clever to use and adjust a stop-loss, trailing them just below resistance as the asset's
                    price climbs. This safeguards profits and ensures that profits are locked in as the market
                    fluctuates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The realization of profits is a scaled process. After surpassing each resistance level, a percentage
                    of the holding is systematically sold. My initial approach involves selling 25% of the holdings at
                    each level, providing a structured method to secure gains while leaving room for more potential
                    upward returns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, allocating a portion of profits to a self-custody wallet, with the intention of
                    preserving and building a long-term HODL savings plan, adds a crucial layer of stability and
                    foresight to one's cryptocurrency portfolio.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, navigating the bullish market requires a well planned strategy to maximize your
                    gains. By incorporating risk management, spot trading, and strategic entry and exit points, one can
                    navigate the cryptocurrency market with confidence. Stay tuned for more insights in upcoming blog
